Description
---
Regions are procedurally generated and populated. Controls can be used to 
navigate regions. Battles are initiated if the player and another trainer come 
into contact. Player/Npc Character and Region types are implemented as classes. 
Pokedex database files will be searched for and parsed. Written in C++.

The program is currently configured to only parse the pokedex file provided as 
the first argument, before then exiting. The current usage is as follows:
./poke [pokemon|moves|pokemon_moves|pokemon_species|experience|type_names]
