01/31/2022 - Started project, created enums that represent tiles in a region, created function to print a region.
02/01/2022 - Implemented randomly generated terrain. (no paths, centers or marts yet)
02/02/2022 - Implemented randomly generated paths. Added poke centers and poke marts.
02/08/2022 - Added support to take a seed as an optional argument.
             Implemented dynamic memory allocation to regions when generated.
             Added controls to navigate between regions.
             Added logic to generate regions with "connecting" exits.
02/09/2022 - Added probabilistic generation of poke centers/marts.
             Added function to free all allocated regions before exit.
02/13/2022 - Added mountain and forest terain types
             Added Dr. Sheaffer's fibonacci queue and update Makefile accordingly.
             Began work on implementing Dijkstra's algorithm.
02/14/2022 - Completed and debugged  Dijkstra's algorithm.
             Added function to print distance maps for various trainer types.
